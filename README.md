# Snake 2.0 (Snake Clone)

This is a clone of the classic game snake. This is not my original idea. The object of the game is to direct the snake around the map using the arrow keys in order to eat the pieces of fruit. Each time the snake eats a piece of fruit, it gets one segment longer. The goal is to eat as many pieces of fruit as possible and make the snake as long as possible without touching the border walls or without the snake touching itself. This project and this code is based on the tutorial from freeCodeCamp on Youtube.com.
